Question 1:

(Ashutosh) 
Yes, let me describe my Netlify website deployment experience in a more casual, approachable way:
As our group project came to an end, we had to launch our website so that everyone could see it. We investigated a few different hosting choices before deciding to try Netlify rather than using Cloudflare which was complex as well. I was facing a lot of difficulties.
The site can be accessed at https://loquacious-faun-7efe90.netlify.app/

I also showed an alternate Cloudflare method for the deployment of our site as https://comp2110-group9.pages.dev/ I faced little difficulty using the Cloudflare account. I used command lines to connect our project GitHub repository to the Cloudflare account. It was a straightforward process.

Question 2
Our team successfully developed a visually stunning and user-friendly task management application. As a team, we worked well together to integrate diverse components and widgets, resulting in a unified and feature-rich platform.

(ASHUTOSH)
My work focused on improving the component, which displays and interacts with specific tasks. I improved the layout and appearance of the task card, resulting in a clean and intuitive depiction of work details. I also added a pop-up task detail view, which allows users to view detailed information about a work, such as its description, due date, and priority level.
I have modified the form dialog to streamline the process of editing task details. Users can now easily alter task metadata, resulting in more effective work management. I added task deletion feature to improve the user experience overall by making it simple for users to remove activities that are completed or superfluous.
I took the extra effort to build a component based on the component that already existed. With the help of this new feature, users can now easily create new tasks right within the program, doing away with the need for external tools or manual data entry. 

(Urvashi)
Apart from my widget, I put my hands-on design part of the pages where needed.

Question 3
(ASHUTOSH)
Throughout this project, our team faced several organizational and technological difficulties. The main technical challenge was figuring out how to use the data structures and API that were provided. It took a great deal of time and work to integrate our components with the current codebase and guarantee smooth data flow.
Organizational issues also arose from the practice of efficiently collaborating and communicating.  Since team members were working on multiple components at once, it became essential to uphold uniform coding standards and prevent disagreements. These problems were lessened by regular meetings and version control using Git, but diligent work and honest communication were still necessary for productive teamwork.

One of the difficulties I had when working on the component was coming up with a clear, simple, and aesthetically pleasing layout that would efficiently display task information without being overly complicated. It took several tries and careful consideration of user experience concepts to find the ideal mix between utility and beauty. Moreover, there were additional difficulties in putting the pop-up task detail view into practice. Thorough attention to detail and testing were necessary to ensure seamless integration with the current codebase and handle edge circumstances, such as jobs with extraordinarily long descriptions or numerous due dates. Notwithstanding these difficulties, our team's commitment and cooperation enabled us to get over roadblocks, share knowledge, and finally produce a well-designed and useful task management application.

Most of the project went well as I feel we all worked as a group nicely and properly allocated and completed the assigned work, I feel that the only challenge that I faced as a group was around using GitHub (branches, merging, etc)  but through the power of teamwork, none of the issues persisted for very long. I think that we worked well as a team, and I am happy with the outcome. 

Individually, I know that I struggled with adjusting to the existing code. When first starting I used a test HTML and CSS to make sure my code worked but implementing it into the existing code proved to be quite the challenge, for a while i could not find which file i had to import my code into, once i had figured it out it didn't take me long to finish my part. The only other issue that i had was with timing, as i had over-anticipated how difficult my task would be, resulting in me not finishing to 100% of my abilities but nonetheless, I am happy with my work and i am happy with what we had accomplished as a team.

(Urvashi)
Group work for the project was really good. We had group calls for problems and discussions of individual tasks. Group members did pretty much help to each other in collaborative way where needed. 

For me, lecture videos helped me understand concepts for different technologies. Initially, I faced issues with loading data on page load. But everything was learning and building project. Overall, I got experience in building process of the website clearly with the team.


Question 4 
Leon 
Having the final work all come together at the end was very rewarding as I felt all of our hard work had paid off. Individually, i felt that watching the weekly videos really contributed to my work as they helped me every step of the way and were the main reason that i could complete my work

Delving into the realm of COMP2110 Web Technology has been an enriching journey, unlocking a newfound appreciation for the intricate tapestry that weaves the World Wide Web. One particularly rewarding aspect was the organic progression from the foundational markup language, HTML, and the cascading style sheets of CSS to the dynamic scripting prowess of JavaScript.

This seamless transition not only unveiled the symbiotic interplay between these languages but also illuminated the multifaceted nature of web development. The ability to breathe life into static web pages through JavaScript's interactive capabilities was nothing short of exhilarating, akin to wielding a digital paintbrush that could imbue websites with vibrant hues of functionality.

Furthermore, exploring the nuances of design principles and security issues developed a greater appreciation for the meticulous craftsmanship required to create user-centric, durable, and impenetrable digital experiences. This comprehensive understanding has enabled me to approach web development with a greater sense of responsibility and steadfast dedication to excellence.

Question 5
Leon
•	I chose to do the animation/explosion widget as I thought it would be a fun one to do and that I thought it would be easy as all I needed to do was make an image grow larger on parts of the screen and move the doing tasks into done
•	One major difficulty I found was getting my code to work with the provided code, it took me a while to search in each js file for where I had to import my code. Another difficulty I faced was the positioning of the explosion itself. As you will see in the final product, I wasn't able to get my explosion position to be outside of the widget box, i tried to force the position to the centre of the screen and other methods but I just couldn't figure it out. Now that I am finished I think that if I had accessed the tasks through my code I could pull the position of the task cards and place an image in each of them

•	I chose the task-card implementation and related modules where i had to implement design in the task card while adding features like add task and delete task  which was done flawlessly
•	The major issue or challenge I had was to do a lot of research and had trouble understanding the base code that was given to us. Moreover, to implement the functionality there were a lot of ways enlisted on the web to do so. Trying to figure which one to be carried out in this specific scenario took time.
•	This experience enhanced my capabilities to search and adapt to new content be it any language. Moreover, most of the practical classes and the unit being loaded with content related helped and a lot provided necessary knowledge.

I selected the calender widget as I like to work and learn on the onload settings and the way code will display the date counts. Firstly, it was a bit tricky to figure out the base code, but then I get the flow of the files after reviewing little. From this widget, I also wanted to build on logical side with the code.
I feel the most challenging part was keeping every team member hooked at the adjusted time. One of our team member also had injury while the second part on the way. Due to lack of clear communication, some might get mislead to think no one is working actively. Apart from synchronicity with the group work, the times we had group calls for discussions, I see equal and whole participation of everyone individually.

My own contribution to the team, I can say that I have reached out to member on equal time intervals for the project to meet deadlines. I have asked offering helping hand from my side if anyone's stuck inbetween to work as a team member. Also, I was concern about the thing that the group task card component was taken by one team member inplace of discussing and working sub-tasks together.




Reflections on the group
Ashutosh
None of the group members seem to respond to any of the conversations that I try to establish. There was a lack of participation by the group members which could have been better. Based on that I have done most of the work for part 3 from deploying to writing this report while others just keep ignoring the assignment. Despite these difficulties, I tried my best to encourage open communication and foster a sense of teamwork. I initiated discussions, asked for opinions, and attempted to create opportunities for everyone to contribute. However, the overall response was often underwhelming, leaving me feeling unsupported and frustrated at times.

Reflections on individual contributions to the group:
Ashutosh
 When reflecting on my own contributions to the group, I can confidently say that I consistently strived to be an active and engaged team member. I regularly participated in discussions, shared my ideas, and provided constructive feedback to others.
I took the initiative to organize and delegate tasks, ensuring that our project stayed on track and deadlines were met. When faced with last-minute contributions or limited input from some team members, I stepped up to fill in the gaps and ensure that our work maintained a high standard of quality.
However, I also recognize that there is always room for improvement. In hindsight, I could have been more proactive in reaching out to quieter team members and finding ways to encourage their participation. I could have also suggested more structured communication channels or set clearer expectations for individual contributions from the outset.
